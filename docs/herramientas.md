# Herramientas de desarrollo

## Developer tools

### Skills (slash commands)
Located in `.claude/commands/`:

- `/validate-game [name]` — checks all quality criteria (sound, graphics, mobile, touch, code) for one or all games
- `/add-sounds [name]` — guides adding `GameAudio` calls to a specific game

### Subagents
Located in `.claude/agents/`:

- `game-validator` — validates a game against the full quality checklist
- `sound-auditor` — audits `GameAudio` coverage across all games
- `mobile-auditor` — audits mobile layout, canvas scaling, and touch handling

### Hooks
`.claude/settings.json` runs a code quality check after every `Edit`/`Write` on a `main.js` file. It warns about:
- `ctx.shadowBlur` inside a loop
- Emoji inside `ctx.fillText()`
- `setInterval` used as game loop without `requestAnimationFrame`
- `Math.random()` called inside a render function
- Missing `GameAudio` integration

## AI patterns used

- **Tic-tac-toe**: full minimax (no depth limit, 3×3 board is always tractable)
- **Connect Four**: minimax with alpha-beta pruning, depth 5; scoring by 4-cell windows in all directions, center column preference
- Both AIs respond after a short delay (300ms) for better UX
